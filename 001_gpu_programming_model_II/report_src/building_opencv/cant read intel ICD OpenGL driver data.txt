[FORUM] Can't find the name of the Intel ICD OpenGL driver?
https://communities.intel.com/thread/110921

	- The boy was having my same error box, he solved it by downgrading graphic driver from 21.20.16.4574 to 20.19.15.4454

	- The answer says: Version 21.20.16.4574 is not a driver that was released by Intel. (it seems that is a dell graphic driver)

	- The answer suggest to install a beta intel driver 15.45.12.4552
